ODEVisualisation
================

ODEVisualisation is a C++/Thrust/Cuda library that has a focus on fast evaluation of high-dimensional sets of ordinary differential equations on a GPU.

The library can be used to:
<ul>
<li>Find and valuate fixed points (attractive and repulsive) in the high-dimensional flow field.<\li>
<li>Visualise two dimensional views of the high-dimensional flow field.<\li>
<li>Integrate the set of ODEs.<\li>
<\ul>

A detailed documentation will follow.
